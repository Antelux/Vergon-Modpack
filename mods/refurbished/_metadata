  "description": "some people asked for me to share this over on the workshop, this mod basically just adds in refurbished versions of a lot of the wrecked and generally rusted/decayed objects in vanilla, all craftable at the wooden workbench. All objects added by this mod start with the word \"refurbished\" so they shouldn't be hard to find. as a bonus I added a freshly painted version of the USCM sign, also craftable at the wooden workbench.\n\nyes, that is a playable moontant in the screenshot for some of the furniture of this mod, they'll be out this summer probably",
