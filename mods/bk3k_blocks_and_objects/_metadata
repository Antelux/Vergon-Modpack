  "description": "[h1]Besides the described contents, this now contains all the prerequisites for the Vepr ship and Shipyard Rebuilt[/h1]\nOf course you don't need either of those mods to enjoy this mod.  But server admins who want to support the Vepr and/or Shipyard (without forcing them on everyone) need only load this mod.  Nothing here should help griefers.\n\nThis mod is a collection of blocks and objects I made.  Initially I made these to be part of my Shipyard Rebuilt mod, but decided to split this off and just make it a requirement. The SR mod is here http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=789841235 but you don't necessarily need it if you only want the blocks and objects. You do however need this mod to use the shipyard.\n\nA better description of what I have here can be found at \nhttp://community.playstarbound.com/resources/bk3ks-blocks-and-objects-formerly-lighted-platforms.3164/\nAlso the discussion tab there is really the best place to get support if you need it. Steam is too limited in many ways.\n\n[h1]Blocks[/h1][list]\n[*]lighted platforms - these useful platforms radiate light and come in several light color choices\n[*]liquidblock - can be painted different colors or invisible, blocks ONLY liquid passage\n[*]black glass (light tint) - much more transparent than vanilla black glass and sloped\n[*]black glass (medium tint) - more transparent than vanilla black glass and sloped\n[*]pressurised glow steel - subtle glow matches their base color and stronger than regular[/list]\n\n[h1]Objects[/h1][list]\n[*]2 x 8 airlock automatic airlock door\n[*]8 x 2 horizontal automatic airlock door\n[*]2 x 8 liquid blocking version of the airlock\n[*]8 x 2 liquid blocking version of the airlock\n[*]Chameleon doors available in [2 x 8], [1 x 8], [1 x 4], [2 x 2], [8 x 2], [8 x 1], [4 x 1] all with or without wire nodes\n[*]8 x 2 horizontal airlock with lunar base platforms built in - inspired by the platform hatches mod.\n[*]a hanging light that I'll have to improve later\n[*]station warehouse locker - 384 slot capacity\n[*]Etherial Platforms - only appear when players are near and dynamically join together\n[*]The airlocks/hatches are now rail-enabled (put rails on both sides and they'll connect when open)[/list]\n\n[h1]Notes[/h1][list]\n[*]The first input and output nodes operate exactly as you'd expect on my doors.\n[*]The 2nd output node of my doors can be used to make the door act as a proximity sensor.  So you can detect a player even when the door is otherwise locked, etc.\n[*]The 2nd input node allows the doors to operate as usual, plus also open when signaled.\n[*]Rails can connect to the airlocks/hatches at any point on the doors you like.  Mod rails should work too - any material with \"rail\" in the name should work.[/list]\n\nSo you have more wiring options by far.  Open a series of doors when any one detects a player, etc.  Or set an alarm when a player is detected(who forgot to push a secret button).\n\nPlenty more stuff is coming, as well as improvements to the existing stuff.\nTabula Rasa Compatible - Look for the bk3k button on the right.\n\n[h1]Check out my other mods too[/h1] \nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/bk3000/myworkshopfiles/?appid=211820&p=1&numperpage=30\nand lornlynx's mods too -\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/solidfake/myworkshopfiles/?appid=211820\n(automatic doors is now a mutual project, but lornlynx is the original author)\n\nFor those that prefer to download from the official Starbound Forums\nhttp://community.playstarbound.com/resources/authors/bk3k.395551/",
