Aimed to completely eradicate the Corporation and megacorps alike, their troops will stop at nothing to achieve their goal.\n\nWhile their hatred for galactic corporations persist, they do not mind travelers and other like-minded individuals visiting their remote outposts- they're always looking for potential recruitments, afterall. Their settlements can be found rarely in desert planets and scarcely on cold planets.\n\n\n[Legion, a new faction, has been added, along with their themed furnitures, weapons and settlements.]\n[The main crafting station- Legion Crucible Mainframe, can be found in legion settlements.]\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/CmXuZTg.png[/img]\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/99Ew9dP.png[/img]\n\n[h1]Letheia Expanded[/h1]\n\n[quote=A Random Letheia Representative]At Letheia, we aim to provide our customers with top quality products at minimum value.

I hope you will enjoy using this mod, and as this is my first mod as well, any feedback would be greatly appreciated.
