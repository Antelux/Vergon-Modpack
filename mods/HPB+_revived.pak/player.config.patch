      This provides a very easy way for other mods to know this mod is loaded - or if something specific is changed that could have been done by one of several mods - and thus available to expand upon/modify/etc.  Or if a change doesn't need to be applied.

      Can be checked while patching this file and/or with simple LUA.  Because this mod built "/modEnvironment",
      the check is slightly cleaner without fear of crashing the script.

      As a matter of fact, I'd like this convention to catch on.
