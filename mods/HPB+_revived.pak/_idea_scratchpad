Variations of some blocks in the new SB "hull" fashion with the external borners, uninterupted interior.
  but with my own material config
  
rails based off some of these blocks and maybe trams/elevators/etc too.

Dedicated "stair" blocks that have that slight overhang lip 
  only on top when material config shows being used as stairs
  I suppose that top layer looking different, wouldn't have lip when used as floor, but would look good as a floor.
    hard-wood flooring/stairs.
    would that look better as... a material mod?


"Stair" blocks like the old "stair rails" mod too?


I wonder if the tools should be ordered now in the mail order catalog. I could add more tabs easily. Them being in "weapons" is a compromise to translate the old mod into how Starbound's stations are set up now. Can't say I love it.

Related - maybe the trim tools should use up their associated material. They're sort of free/unlimited right now, only taking some material to craft them. I could remove that requirement if I move their crafting to a tab in the MoC. 


colony deeds matching different blocks
