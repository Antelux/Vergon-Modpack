  "description": "[h1]It's back! Tilesets, material modifiers, ship parts, ship furniture, storage lockers, and tools to create custom works.[/h1]\nYou can find the original megamod (by simulatoralive) here - \nhttp://community.playstarbound.com/resources/hull-plating-blocks-more.2998/\nThe description is out of date though, but it can give you a good idea. Keep in mind this mod hasn't been officially updated since Dec 15, 2015. It has been necessary to change a lot in the course of reviving this, as Starbound has changed considerably since then.\n\nThis mod adds a ton of blocks, block mods (with tools to install them into blocks), and objects with a primary focus on ship parts. But I guarantee custom ship builder or not, you'll find things you can use here to build better custom houses, structures, etc. You won't quickly run out of things to try out.\n\n[h1]Currently contains[/h1][list]\n[*]508 objects\n[*]339 solid material tiles\n[*]40 platforms\n[*]83 material modifiers (can be added to tiles via trim tools)[/list]\nThis has integrated the More Craftable Blocks mod as well.  The original is outdated.\n\nWill there be more to come? Certainly. I probably should build a big master list of plans. Besides myself, some other modders have expressed interest in adding things too.\n\nCertainly this description is inadequate(the original description link is better). I'll have to fix it too eventually - including new screen shots (the old images are JPG and the they don't translate well to Steam, but are less distorted if you click on the pictures) - yet I strongly suggest giving this mod a go. If you don't like it, I'll provide a full refund!\n\n[h1]Clarification[/h1]\n[u]Many people seem to be under the impression this mod will change your ship.  It will not![/u]  You'd need a mod like BYOS, Custom Capsule, Mad Tulip, etc.  There is also BYOS build into FU and [u]the thrusters/boosters from this mod will function like FU BYOS parts[/u].  If you have one of these other mods, then THIS mod can give you far more parts to work with.  If not, well many of the things are useful even without wanting to build your own ship.\n\n[h1]Current issues[/h1]\nThe only real problem needing fixed still is the added engines don't change animation in FTL and their objects will need completely reworked to fix it. I already fixed the boosters in this way. I didn't even really want to release the mod with this problem - minor as it is - but people are playing SB 1.3 now so I might as well not delay further.\n\nThere is definitely things to fill in, like hatch variations for all the doors. And lots of things in consideration of the vanilla content we've gotten since. Recipe adjustments may come (but a considerable amount of that has already occurred).\n\nAgain remember this was a Beta Starbound mod, so some things don't match perfectly with how Starbound works now. Things will be better ironed out in time. Not to say you can't offer some suggestions. I welcome feedback. No guarantee I'll agree, but even if I don't you might get me thinking.\n\n[h1]Compatibility/problems[/h1]\nThe question usually comes up - \"is this compatible with <insert mod here>?\" The answer should be yes. I'll make (and already have made) every effort to keep it working good with other mods. Where that isn't the case (if I missed something), [u][b]please provide your starbound.log file[/b][/u] and I'll see what can be done to fix this.  You can find it in \\starbound\\storage\\ and upload the contents to Pastebin, then drop a link here.  [u][b]There is very little to be done without the logs[/b][/u].\n\n[h1]Other mods[/h1]\nBlocks from the original have ended up in numerous other mods, so you may have seen a few already. That's actually completely acceptable because the original(and this version) are open permissions.  But where they've done things like change the pathing while keeping the materialId, that can pose a problem.  I've adjusted to the ones I know of before reviving the mod, but it is problematic to do this after launching the mod.\n[list]\n[*]Mad Tulip's ship mod - They have a few assets from the original HPB+ mod but re-pathed and with the materialId unchanged. That left me the sole option of patching these things in their mod to a new materialId range(within the reserved range for this mod). So existing users of that mod may have a few platforms turn to dirt. That's unavoidable, sorry for the inconvenience. Shouldn't be a problem moving forward. The mods should work together.\n\nNote that their mod is workshop only, so you'll need to use the workshop version of this mod for both to work together - because of a load order issue between workshop and manually installed mods.\n[*]Tabula Rasa mod - This mod is Tabula Rasa enabled, including a custom button to find this all mod's assets in the Tabula Rasa. This isn't a required mod though.\n\nSome say the mod is broken, but that isn't so. Just a little outdated and easily addressed. It expects a few vanilla images at a certain path, and that path moved in vanilla. So I just re-added those images where it expects them... mod fixed!\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Attribution[/h1]\nOriginal mod by simulatoralive\nAs is only decent, I should forward the credits given on the original page\n\n[quote]Contributors to this Mod\n\nPohany - The original Carbon Fiber Hull Plating base image.\nZoomah - Graciously allowed me to re-purpose code from the Staff of Regrowth mod for the sake of making a tool to place Material Modifiers on blocks.\nHuggableCreep and thesidofevil - Allowed me to use (and heavily modify) a tile template they created for ship trim. The template file is found at \"tiles/shiptrimtemplate.config\" in the mod's folder.\nStorm_UK - I borrowed a little art from More Tiles and Greebles for the Rubium Eye Tool.\n[/quote]\ncapt_slowpoke - More Craftable Blocks is now integrated into this mod (with permission).\n\nThis section may grow as others contribute.\n\n[h1]Also check out my other mods[/h1]\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/bk3000/myworkshopfiles/?appid=211820&p=1&numperpage=30\n\nThe original author has another mod here -\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=850618279\n\nFor those that prefer to download from the official Starbound Forums, you can find my mods here\nhttp://community.playstarbound.com/resources/authors/bk3k.395551/",
