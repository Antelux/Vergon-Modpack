It needed a change, but this probably isn't the final form.  It is for now... more fitting than being named after every obsolete station/group there is.

A few of the names match vanilla names.  But most others tell about the category, and the crafting group all at the same time.  It seems easier to handle.  However I don't love the inconsistency.
