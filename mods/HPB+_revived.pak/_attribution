Contributors to this Mod

Pohany - The original Carbon Fiber Hull Plating base image.
Zoomah - Graciously allowed me to re-purpose code from the Staff of Regrowth mod for the sake of making a tool to place Material Modifiers on blocks.
HuggableCreep and thesidofevil - Allowed me to use (and heavily modify) a tile template they created for ship trim. The template file is found at "tiles/shiptrimtemplate.config" in the mod's folder.
Storm_UK - I borrowed a little art from More Tiles and Greebles for the Rubium Eye Tool.
